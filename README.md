# Bug Bounty

To kick off the testnet release, we’re holding a bug bounty program with TSX rewards for our Community Developers to help ensure that TradeStars has no major bugs. This will run until mainnet is deployed or the amount of TSX reserved for the program (100,000) is accounted for.

## Bounty Program
The bug bounty program will commence on January 25th, 2021, and run until mainnet launch. The scope of this program is to double-check functionality related to deposits, withdrawals, transactions and other functions. We are specifically looking for issues related to:
- Security of user assets in the platform.
- Issues around deposits and withdrawals, and transaction values.
- General issues about deployment
- Admin control issues.
- Other process breakdowns.

## Bounty Rules
Rewards for bugs are issued first come first serve. Issues that have already been flagged are not eligible for rewards.
Description of vulnerabilities must be submitted.
Rewards will be distributed at the end of the bug bounty program.
We will keep you updated on the status of your submitted issue.

## Submission Guidelines
Use the following repository for submitting issues. You’ll need an account at https://github.com.
https://github.com/tradestars-app/testnet-bounty/issues
Please be as detailed as possible completing the bug report template provided and use clear, concise phrases when filing the bug report, how to reproduce it and your configured system settings at the moment.
Also please include your ETH wallet address that we should use for reward distribution.
## Rewards
Rewards will be based on severity which is derived from impact and likelihood.

- Critical bugs: Issues that can result in hack, compromising the user private key, or platform collapse. Up to 4,500 TSX
- Major bugs: Issues which can cause significant problems when using the platform, such as issues with validating user deposits and withdrawals, malformed transactions. Up to 2,000 TSX
- Minor bugs: Small issues, not platform breaking but still a damper and great to resolve early. Such as incorrect data shown by the UI, unexpected behavior, etc. Up to 1,000 TSX
- Useful feedback: Comments that while not specifying a bug, can help improve confidence and integrity of the system. Up to 500 TSX
- Help Document Building(FAQ/White Papers/Help): Valid comments which help develop the documents better. Up to 200 TSX
